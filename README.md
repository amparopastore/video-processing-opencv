# Image/Video Processing with OpenCV

In this notebook, we will be analyzing image and video data from two videos. The first video is a brain activity map from Erik Duboue's lab, called BrainWideCalciumImage.gif. This video captures the activity in a brain in response to a stimulus. Our goal in analyzing this video is to identify the frame in which the brain responds to the stimulus. The second video (pa_sat_42dpf_groupB_n5_20210522_2021-05-22-082249_short.mkv) is a top view of 5 Mexican cavefish swimming in a tank from the former Cavefish trilab by Alex Keene, Erik Duboue, and Johanna Kowalko. We will be subtracting the background from this video to get a clearer view of the fish.
